# basic script to load maps


# copy and edit this file as necessary
# common changes include the following:
# specified linkage groups
# different column headings
# "pos" field versus separate "chromosome" and "position" fields

=head1 NAME

load_map_data.pl - a script to load maps into the SGN database.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

usage: load_map_data -H dbhost -D dbname [-r] [-n "map name"] [-i map_id] <map file>

example: load_map_data.pl -H devel -D sandbox -r -i 9 map-file.csv

Options:

=over 5

=item -H

The hostname of the server hosting the database.

=item -D

the name of the database

=item -r

(optional) if present, rollback after the script terminates. Database should not be affected. Good for test runs.

=item -i

(optional) the map_id. If not present, will insert a brand new map (confirm dialog).

=item -v 

add data to map version provided. Conflicts with -i and -n.

=item -n

required if -i is not used. Provides the map name.

=item -l

specify name of linkage groups as a comma separated list:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
default is names from one to twelve. 

=item -f

force to 'unknown' protocol type if no protocol is provided.

=back

The tab-delimited map file has the following columns:

 MARKER
 CONFIDENCE
 LINKAGE_GROUP
 POSITION (must be a float! 0.0 )
 PROTOCOL
