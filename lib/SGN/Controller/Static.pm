SGN::Controller::Static - a controller for dispatching to static pages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SGN has some static pages that don't merit their own controller. The purpose of this one is to have one common controller for all the static pages that don't fit anywhere else.

Please feel free to add your own pages. The actions should essentially just link to a mason component for display.
